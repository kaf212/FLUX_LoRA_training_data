A vivid winter scene, capturing a modern high-speed train stationed at a train station. The train, painted in a striking red and white color scheme, is captured in motion, with its sleek design and aerodynamic shape clearly visible. The station itself is a two-story building with a beige facade, adorned with a red awning and a sign reading 'Wassen'. The surrounding landscape is blanketed in snow, with snow-covered trees and mountains in the background. The sky is clear, suggesting a sunny day, and the overall atmosphere is serene and tranquil.
