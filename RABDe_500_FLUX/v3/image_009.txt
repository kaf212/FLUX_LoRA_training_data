A vivid, high-resolution photograph capturing a scenic landscape. The main subject is a modern train, painted in red and white, traveling over a stone viaduct. The train is elevated, suggesting it's in motion. The surrounding environment is lush and verdant, with steep, rocky mountains in the background and a valley below. The mountains are densely packed with greenery, and the valley below is dotted with houses and roads. The sky is clear, indicating a sunny day. The style of the image is candid, capturing a moment in time without any posed or staged elements. The coloration is rich and vibrant, with the green of the trees and mountains contrasting against the blue of the sky and the white of the train.
