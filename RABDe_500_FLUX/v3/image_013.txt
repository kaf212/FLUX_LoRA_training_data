A vivid, high-resolution landscape photograph capturing a serene countryside scene. The main subject is a lush green meadow dotted with a few trees, leading to a rustic wooden barn with a sloping roof. A train, with its sleek white and red design, travels through the valley, its red and white livery contrasting against the greenery. The backdrop is dominated by towering, snow-capped mountains that rise majestically against a clear blue sky. The foreground features a well-maintained green pasture with a solitary tree, and a small settlement with red-roofed buildings nestled in the valley. The overall color palette is a harmonious blend of greens, browns, and blues, evoking a sense of tranquility and natural beauty.
