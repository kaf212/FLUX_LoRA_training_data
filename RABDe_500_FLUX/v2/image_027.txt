A vivid, high-resolution photograph capturing a serene riverside scene. The main subject is a modern train, painted in white and red, crossing a stone bridge over a calm river. The river reflects the blue sky and the surrounding greenery. On the left, there's a picturesque town with red-roofed buildings, and on the right, a tall, stone tower with a pointed roof stands prominently. The sky is clear with a few scattered clouds, and the overall color palette is dominated by blues, greens, and earthy tones.
