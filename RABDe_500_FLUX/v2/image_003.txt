A vivid, high-resolution photograph capturing a modern train in motion along a railway track. The train, painted in a striking red and white color scheme, is the central focus, with its sleek design and streamlined shape. The surrounding landscape is lush and green, with a backdrop of a hillside covered in yellow flowers. The hillside is dotted with trees and shrubs, and there's a small structure, possibly a barn or shed, nestled among the greenery. The sky is clear, suggesting a sunny day. The photograph is taken from a low angle, emphasizing the train's height and the depth of the landscape. The image is well-lit, likely taken during the daytime, and the overall mood is serene and picturesque.
